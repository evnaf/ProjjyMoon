# Project Moonglow

In Project Moonglow, players take on the role of an engineer who has just inherited a struggling factory. The goal is to renovate and modernize the factory to turn it into a profitable business while also tending to a farm to support the factory's operations.

Gameplay:

The factory is the main focus of the game, and players must manage its production lines, upgrade machinery, hire workers, and research new technologies to stay ahead of competitors.
The lab is essential for the factory's success, providing resources like metal, plastic, and energy. 
To create a more immersive experience, players must also manage the factory's impact on the environment. This includes implementing green energy solutions, managing waste, and preventing pollution.
As players progress through the game, they can expand the factory, unlock new technologies, and hire more workers to increase production. They can also participate in competitions and trade fairs to showcase their products and win awards.
The game would also include social elements, such as interacting with NPCs and building relationships with other engineers and farmers in the game world.
Overall, Project Moonglow would offer a unique blend of chemistry and engineering gameplay, challenging players to balance the demands of the factory and the lab while also considering the impact on the environment.
